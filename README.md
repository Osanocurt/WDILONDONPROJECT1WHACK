# WDILONDONPROJECT1WHACK
Old childhood game called Whack A Mole.
This was my first ever attempt at such a task.
It was very exciting prospect that sounded so simple to do at first, the planning side of it was really exciting with all sorts of ideas floating around in my mind.

There was a brief on what your game should include, certain techniques that we have been taught since the begining of the course.

It all started on a piece of paper with lots of drawings and ideas that seemed simple but when it came to implementing them it wasnt so simple.

The idea was simple enough to have a grid based game as thats what we have covered so far in  class. At first i was thing of a collision based game but then i was glad i did not attempt that just yet.

Getting started was not very hard as i hav ementioned we have covered alot of grid based games that were still fresh on the mind. 

At first i went with the approach of having tiles in a grid with a picture of a mole apperaing and dissaperaing at random.

This was very simple to do but then i thought to try ggo a step further by having the grids flash or somethign appear on them at random. There were many ways to do this and the more ideas and styles i saw the more exciting it got, at first i started off with just a square and no grids but on the square there was a random funtion behind it that a pictur eof a mole popped up ever so often. The idea was sound but it was not very tidy, The random event was popping in and out all over my page and even over my text and styles which just did not look good. 

Also the code that i wrote for this was very messy and also outdated i soon found  that out.

I was taking what we had learned in class and also used out side material to mix and match a final product which i found it really helped me learn alot through trial and error. There was a lot going wrong with the simplest of tasks.

First hurdle was how to go about generating the random function for my board. This was achieved by going over old notes and also research on how i understood it best. 
The second hurdle was to create a way on how someone won the game so basically how to start and end the game.
 This was challenging in the sense that before i even got the game working that i was thinking of adding difficulty levels, 2 player games and so on. Going back on breaking it all down on its simplest form helped in taking small steps. 

**STEPS TAKEN.**

1.Create board.

2.Create a random function to randomise the apperance of the moles.

3.Make sure your click events register when you click.

4.Create a win or lose element of the game.

5.Score board.

6.Refresh the game once it comes to the end.

7.Make sure the code is readable with no errors.

8.Implement as many methods as you can from what we learnt in class.

9.CSS to style it all after.

10.Cleaning up my code with out breaking it was probably my biggest hurdle,
All in all i would say the brief for this project was met and there is a fully functional game that can be enjoyed online with out any issues arrising. 



Project #1: The Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** â€“ since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

---
### Technical Requirements

Your app must:
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---
### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
